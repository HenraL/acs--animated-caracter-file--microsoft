 Vox Proxy Is A Program Where You Can Make Microsoft Agents On PowerPoint Presentations. When You Download It You Get A Character Named Paul A Character Where You Can't Download On Any Character Site. And When You Download It You Get A 30-Day Trial And When It Expires You Have To Buy A Code. But I Recommend Not To Buy A Code Because You Can Use MASH Which It's Similar To Vox Proxy, But You Can Download It To Get The Character Paul.
